Hello! I am a master student at Georgia Tech, currently studying Computational Science and Engineering. I am actively seeking for SDE internship opportunities for Summer 2024 and Fall 2024. 

## About Me
Having graduated with First Class Honors in BEng Civil Engineering from the University of Edinburgh, I continued to advance my education by pursuing an M.S. in Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where I was honored with the Tishman Fellowship. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Beyond my academic endeavors, my hands-on experience at the University of Michigan's Dynamic Project Management Lab allowed me to delve deep into the synergy of human-robot collaborations in construction, and at Accenture Technology Malaysia, I led the assessment of digital content to ensure platform compliance. My passion for technology is further evident in my personal projects, such as the Threads App, a MERN stack authentication application, and a comprehensive E-Commerce platform, each highlighting my skills in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, from React and MongoDB to JWT authentication and Stripe integration. My journey, blending both academia and practical experience, showcases my dedication to pushing boundaries in technology and engineering.
